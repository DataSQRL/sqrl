 * testcontainers has a hard dependency on JUnit4, which we would like to avoid, migrating to
 * JUnit5 (aka junit jupiter). Until testcontainers updates their package to remove this dependency,
 * a workaround is needed to avoid the "org.junit.rules.TestRule not found" error. The two files
 * Statement.java and TestRule.java seem to accomplish this, following a comment in the github thread
 * where multiple people are encountering the same problem:
 * https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/970#issuecomment-625044008
