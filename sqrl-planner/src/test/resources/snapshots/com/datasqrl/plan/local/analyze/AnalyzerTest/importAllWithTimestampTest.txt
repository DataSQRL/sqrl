[FATAL] Cannot use timestamp with import star
in script:test.sqrl [1:35]:
IMPORT ecommerce-data.* TIMESTAMP _ingest_time AS c_ts;
----------------------------------^
IMPORT star (*) cannot have a timestamp.

Erroneous code example:
```
IMPORT ecommerce-data.* TIMESTAMP time / 10 AS ts;
```

Setting a timestamp to all modules is not supported, try importing them one at a time. Example:
```
IMPORT ecommerce-data.Orders TIMESTAMP time / 10 AS ts;
IMPORT ecommerce-data.Product TIMESTAMP time / 10 AS ts;
IMPORT ecommerce-data.Customer TIMESTAMP time / 10 AS ts;
```
