# SQRL Example applications

> **Warning**
> Only the retail and nutshop examples are currently functional. To play with DataSQRL, we recommend you use the nutshop example. Retail is mostly used for internal testing.

This repository contains a number of example applications implemented in SQRL.

The examples are based on real world applications but generalized, abstracted, or anonymized so you can use them freely for your own project.
Most examples come with example data. This data is often synthetically generated.

Currently, this module mostly serves as a source of inspiration as we develop the SQRL langauge and most examples are just stubs or work-in-progress.
