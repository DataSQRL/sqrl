After implementing technology to capture data from various high-frequency sources such as financial applications, sensors and IoT devices, teams often find themselves struggling to build and roll out best practices quickly. They inevitably fall behind on the performance and scalability demands of the business.\n \nIn this session, Mike Rosam and Tun Shwe will share their experiences of building data teams at McLaren and fast growth startups. They will take you on a journey of how they navigated their way from the old batch world to the new streaming world, where real-time decisions are enabled by stream processing and are within the reach of every data team.\n \nAttendees will learn the common sources of friction against streaming technologies in organisations, be able to identify the pain points that lead to streaming adoption, prioritisation based on data maturity and how to gain a competitive edge by focusing on culture and value. So, buckle up and join us on this high-speed adventure to the promised land!"}
