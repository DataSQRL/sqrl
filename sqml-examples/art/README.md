Art Use Case: Poetry Cloud

Poetry Cloud is a collaborative writing platform that allows poets (and those aspiring to be)
to post arbitrary snippets of poetry other other inspirational text that they can link to other
posts. This creates a public web of poetry ideas that any user can follow to get inspired
in their work and follow what other poets are writing about.
