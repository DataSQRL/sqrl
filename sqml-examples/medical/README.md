# Medical Use Case: Adverse Drug Reactions

An adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurs when a patient develops a medical condition as a result of taking one or multiple drugs. Adverse drug reaction is a serious problem leading to more than 2 million hospitalizations per year and over 100,000 deaths which makes it the 4th leading cause of death in the United States according to the FDA.

An ADR can be triggered because the patient is allergic to a chemical compound in the drug, because the patient’s condition or predisposition make them vulnerable to drug side effects, or because of an interaction between multiple drugs the patient is taking simultaneously. In addition to the complex and numerous causes for ADRs, the operational reality of a hospital environment can make it challenging to prevent ADRs: multiple doctors treating the same patient, lack of awareness of a patient’s entire medical history paired with patient’s incomplete memory, time pressures, and communication failures.

Electronic health record systems contain a lot of the information needed for early ADR detection, but the data is scattered across many systems, difficult to analyze, and needs to be evaluated quickly to prevent ADRs before drugs are administered. That’s why SQML is a great fit for the use case of ADR prevention: It allows you to quickly integrate data from various systems to collect all the information needed to detect possible ADRs and a simple language that makes detection easy to implement and near real-time so we can alert doctors before the prescription goes into effect.
