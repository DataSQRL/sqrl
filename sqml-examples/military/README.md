# Military Use Case: Deployment Logistics

This use case tracks the deployment of various platforms on a platoon basis to provide
an overview of all platoon activities, identify health issues, as well as track and identify
foreign platforms.

This use case is inspired by a similar use case from the Stanford STREAM project: http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/sqr/milmon.html
