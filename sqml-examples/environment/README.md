# Environmental Use Case: Wildfire Detection

There are number of sensor placed within the Washington forests that periodically take temperature
and Co2 measurements and submit them via satelite link to a central collection station.

In this use case, we are building an API that allows researches to access the sensors and their
readings.

In addition, we look for temperature and co2 deviations to trigger wildfire alerts.

Finally, we analyze frequent deviations to determine if a sensor may be broken or
needs servicing.
