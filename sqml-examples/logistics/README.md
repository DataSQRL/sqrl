# Logistics Use Case: Package Tracking

In this use case, we collect the shipment events for packages to track them in realtime.

We implement two APIs:

- Looking up shipments by tracking number and getting details on where that shipment currently is, recent event history, and shipment details.
- Realtime analytics to track shipment delays and high inventory at distribution centers.
