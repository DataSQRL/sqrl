# Transportation Use Case: Bus Tracking

This application allows bus riders to track busses along their preferred routes and be notified of delays.
You can generalize the techniques from this application to other types of logistics and vehicle tracking applications.

BusConcierge is a mobile application that makes taking the bus more convenient and predictable for commuters and anybody else who regularly uses public bus transit.

The application tracks busses along their routes to gives riders greater visibility into their whereabouts. It also estimates actual arrival times so riders know when they should be at their stop.

The app uses the GPS location data from each bus that is collected in realtime as well as schedule, route, and rider information to compile the data.

In a separate application, we use that same data to aggregate realtime statistics on bus punctuality and bus ridership for the transit authority's operations center.
