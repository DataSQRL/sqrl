# E-Commerce Use Case: Online Auction

This e-commerce use case implements some of the backend systems for an online auction site
where users can auction off items and bid on items they wish to acquire.

This use case is inspired by a similar auction example of the STREAM project at Stanford: http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream/sqr/onauc.html
