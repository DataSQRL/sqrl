# SQRL Governance

## General principles

The principles set the tone of the operation of SQRL:

* The project's activities ensure open collaboration in order to build a community of people who are
  interested in its success.
* The scope of the project's content is determined by the individuals who are actively contributing.
* An individual's privileges and position are awarded through their contribution and engagement.

These principles should be respected as the procedures used to manage the SQRL project are evolved
and matured.

## SQRL community members

Anyone can become a member of the SQRL community by signing up to the
the SQRL mailing list, joining the slack community, attending the project online meetings
or contributing content to one of more of the GitHub repositories.

The [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how to connect to these channels.

All participants in the SQRL community are bound by the project's
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As a member you are able to attend our meetings, just to listen, or to play an active part in the
discussion.
The online meetings are recorded to allow community members to catch up if they are not able to
attend the live meeting.
When you attend the community meetings specifically, your name will be recorded in the meeting
minutes along with any remarks or suggestions you make.
The agenda and minutes of our community meetings are publicly available on
the [wiki](https://github.com/SQRL/SQRL/wiki).

A member may make contributions to the SQRL content by submitting a
GitHub pull request on the appropriate Git repository.
This will be reviewed and processed by the **SQRL committers**.

Community members can progress to be **SQRL Contributors** and then **SQRL Committers**.

### SQRL contributors

SQRL contributors are members who have actively taken additional steps to promote and foster the
success of SQRL and its acceptance/adoption across the IT community. The activities that
contributors engage in might include:

* Actively participate in meetings and discussions
* Promote the goals of SQRL and the benefits of open metadata to the IT community (deliver
  presentations, informal talks, assist at trade shows, independent blogs, etc.)
* Assist in the recruitment of new members
* Contribute where appropriate to documentation and code reviews, specification development,
  demonstration assets and other artifacts that help move SQRL forward

#### How to become a contributor

Being recognized as an SQRL contributor is done by nomination of an SQRL committers with a majority
vote
of SQRL committers to confirm.

SQRL's contributors are recognized in the [contributors list](CONTRIBUTORS.md)

### SQRL project committers

Committers are members of the SQRL community that have permission to change the SQRL content.
This may be content that they have created themselves, or has been provided by another member.
Committers also have responsibility for helping other project members with their contributions.
This includes:

* Monitoring email aliases.
* Monitoring Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).
* Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
* Make sure that ongoing git pull requests are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.

#### How to become a committer

New committers are voted onto the committers list by the existing committers - see
[committer list](COMMITTERS.md).

The committers vote and if a majority agree then the requester
is added to the committers list and given write access to the git repositories.

Once confirmed, you can publicly refer to yourself as an SQRL committer.

#### When does a committer lose maintainer status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the committers per the voting process below.
Emeritus committers can rejoin the committer list through a vote of the
existing committers.

### SQRL leadership

The leadership of SQRL is granted through a vote of the SQRL committers.
SQRL is currently led by Julien Le Dem.

## SQRL project meetings

Some meetings are face-to-face, but most are conference calls.  
Attendance at meetings is open to all. Conference calls can be joined without an explicit
invitation.
However, due to physical security requirements at some of the venues we use,
it is necessary to ensure you are added to the invitee list of any face-to-face meetings
that you wish to attend and complete the necessary formalities for the venue.

For example, the face-to-face meeting may be at a conference that requires you to register for the
conference to attend.
Or a meeting may be at an organization's offices that are required to maintain a list of everyone on
site.

## SQRL on Slack

SQRL uses the [a Slack community](http://bit.ly/SQRLSlack) to provide an ongoing dialogue between
members.
This creates a recorded discussion of design decisions and discussions that complement the project
meetings.

Follow the link above and register with the slack service using your email address.
Once signed in you can see all of the active slack channels.

Additional channels are added from time to time as new workgroups and discussion topics are
established.

## SQRL email

SQRL uses the [discussion list](https://groups.google.com/g/SQRL)
for more general discussion.

## SQRL content management tools

The SQRL content is managed in GitHub
under [https://github.com/SQRL/SQRL](https://github.com/SQRL/SQRL).
It may be developed using patches, branches from main, or forks/git pull requests.
Each change should have a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SQRL/SQRL/issues) explaining why the
change is being made.
See: [CONTRIBUTING.md]

When new content proposed to the project, the person contributing is required to sign the
contribution
to confirm it conforms to
the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

## SQRL project releases

The SQRL team aim to create regular official release of SQRL.

In between official releases, the latest build is also available to developers in GitHub.

### Release process

Anyone may request a new release of the project in the #general channel.

After one is proposed, committers have 48 hours to give a +1 or -1.

A total of three +1s, taking into account -1s and excluding votes by the proposer, authorize the
release.

Alternatively, if after 2 days the release has received at least one +1 and no -1s, the release is
also authorized.

If the proposed release receives no +1s in two days, it is not authorized and the proposer must make
a new request to reset the clock.

## Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and committer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the committers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the committers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each committer receives one
vote.
