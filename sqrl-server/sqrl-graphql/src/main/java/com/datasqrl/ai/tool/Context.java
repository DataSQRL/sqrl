 * The {@link Context} class captures the context of an agent interaction. It has a request id that

 * invoked in the course of producing a request response.

 * <p>Additional key-value pairs can be provided to securely pass information to the function calls
 * outside the LLM call stack.
 *
 * <p>The request id and secure information are static for the duration of an interaction. The
 * counter is incremented for each time the LLM is invoked.
