As data platforms and systems scale so does the ability of stakeholders to create more and more data. More data means things are harder to find. Data products need to be cataloged on the go not only for discovery but also for governance purposes. Not only that, data can exist in many forms - reports, tables, files, streams, services, logs and may go through multiple hops of processing by multiple teams before it becomes a curated data product. Furthermore, a typical data organization will have a plethora of platform and infrastructure pieces - some open source, some cloud based and some custom. To build a robust discovery ecosystem, cataloging must happen continuously, at each hop and for every component in the organization. This becomes challenging without a central team overseeing the entire process.\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about how we solved the problem of cataloging and discovery using Datahub as our discovery platform. I will cover the details of how we went about ingesting metadata from a plethora of infrastructure and platform components(such as Snowflake, Looker, Terraform, Airflow, Kinesis, custom declarative configs etc) that are involved in a typical data product lifecycle at Chime. I will also talk about the processes and design principles we used to make cataloging and data governance a part of our dna.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Sherin Thomas ","title":" Staff Software Engineer ","company":" Sherin Thomas "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614Z"}

Recently, initiatives like Data Mesh have recognized that pushing analytics products down to people at all levels of the org chart can make for a more responsive and competitive organization. But what about people outside the organization? It used to be that you wanted to see their data, but now they need to see yours. Users are the final frontier of analytics, and going forward, you may have less and less of a choice whether to expose analytics products to your customers themselves.\n\nThis requires a completely re-engineered approach to data infrastructure. Apache Pinot is a database built from the ground up to ingest streaming data from Apache Kafka and serve filtered, grouped, and aggregated results in tens of milliseconds rather than tens of seconds. Built at LinkedIn to expose the social network's data to users as game-changing application features, Pinot is now powering user-facing analytics in real-time, event-driven systems in many different businesses all over the world. Come to this talk to understand the forces that have given rise to this class of database, learn about Pinot's internals, and see some examples of it in action.","location":"Breakout Room 2","speakers":[{"name":" Tim Berglund ","title":" VP Developer Relations ","company":" StarTree "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614Z"}

Responding to an ever changing landscape of attacks and exploits requires a system that can not only handle the scale and dynamic nature of the data but also a dynamically changing set of detection rules. We developed Confluent SIGMA, an open source project built on Kafka Streams for the open SIGMA DSL, to handle real-time rule additions and modifications. In this talk we will cover:\n* The architecture of our Kafka Streams layer that makes it possible to use external data feeds as rule input\n* How we handle dynamic criteria for joins and filters\n* Best practices for writing dynamic rule engines in Kafka Streams\n* Upcoming improvements to Kafka Streams to support versioned rules\nAlthough Confluent SIGMA focuses on cyber threat detection this same pattern can also be applied to any DSL (domain specific language) that would benefit from real-time stream processing.

These real time applications were built upon diverged frameworks (e.g. Spark Streaming, Storm, Flink, and internally developed frameworks using Kafka Consumer API) without standardization on processing logics. It led to repeated processing of similar logic, multiple codebases to maintain, low data quality, and inconsistency with offline datasets. These negatively impact scalability, reliability, efficiency and data accuracy of these applications and eventually affect the real-time content recommendation quality and user experience.\n\nTo address these challenges, we unified the way of consuming events in our real time applications by consolidating the compute engines to Flink, splitting events in those common topics by engagement types, generating cleansed events with standardized processing to align on business concepts. Throughout these efforts, we achieved multi-million dollar infrastructure savings and double-digit engagement gain after applications adopted those cleansed events.\n\nMoving forward, we are implementing frameworks for better tracking and governing the Kafka events and real time use cases.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Lu Liu ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Pinterest "},{"name":" Heng Zhang ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Pinterest "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614Z"}

These two distinct competing functions invariably contend for the available compute resources, which makes it difficult to handle situations where there are unexpected bursts of either streaming ingestion or queries that can slow down the system. We will examine common approaches to the problem of compute contention, such as scaling, replication, and querying from shared storage, and discuss their tradeoffs and how they remain incomplete solutions.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a real-time analytics architecture we implemented in the Rockset database, based on RocksDB, that effectively isolates streaming data ingestion from query serving. RocksDB is a popular log-structured merge-tree storage engine that writes to an in-memory memtable and periodically flushes to disk.\n\nCore to our architecture is the separation of compute and storage. This allows multiple RocksDB instances to query from the same shared storage. We use cloud object storage to ensure durability and use SSD as a shared hot storage tier for low-latency reads. On the compute side, we designed our query processing engine to be completely separate from all the modules that perform data ingestion.\n\nFor fresh data to be available to multiple compute units, it is essential that the in-memory state of the ingester's RocksDB memtable be replicated to other RocksDB instances. We built a RocksDB memtable replicator that propagates changes to remote instances in single-digit milliseconds. This architecture enables compute isolation so that real-time streaming ingestion does not interfere with queries, while still allowing the most recent data to be queried.","location":"Breakout Room 4","speakers":[{"name":" Nathan Bronson ","title":" Principal Architect ","company":" Rockset "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614Z"}

However, this is a difficult task for two reasons. First, cutting costs without sacrificing latency or correctness requires deep knowledge of engine implementation details and a keen eye to identify opportunities. Second, optimization techniques are less accessible when working with high-level language abstraction, such as SQL. These techniques often involve engine query planning, requiring even deeper expertise.

How Would We?","abstract":"Although cloud-based, managed Kafka offerings abstract away most administrative responsibilities, a few admin-related concerns remain‚Äì‚Äìlike cluster scaling. When is scaling your cloud-based Kafka appropriate? And how should you set it up to auto-scale?\n\nGone are the days of over-provisioning resources to meet expected demand. Technologies like kubernetes make it relatively simple to implement strategies around both horizontal and vertical scaling. Cloud providers give users the ability to track their resource utilization and set up autoscaling groups and policies. Cloud administrators use these tools (and others) to guarantee their applications can handle the demands placed on them. With Kafka being a central pillar of our cloud-native data pipelines it requires administrators to determine if, when and how to scale Kafka as their workloads ebb and flow.\n\nIn this session, we‚Äôll explore the topic of auto-scaling by implementing a strategy for Confluent Cloud resources.

Everyone wants to be aware of everything everywhere, all at once. Growing demand for quick decision-making has propelled the fascinating world of real-time machine learning (RTML) into the spotlight.\n\nOver the years, brilliant minds developed and refined a number of fantastic ML techniques. Yet, the impatient users are boohooing: we want our data now (read: low latency), and we like our data fresh (read: dynamic data adaptability), and we also want it to be cheap (read: utilize resources efficiently).\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore the evolution of solutions to these challenges and how ML systems are advancing toward online inference and continual learning.\n\nBy the end of our talk, attendees will leave with an understanding of the latest RTML techniques and the essential factors to consider when designing and implementing real-time machine-learning solutions.","location":"Breakout Room 2","speakers":[{"name":" Oli Makhasoeva ","title":" Director of Developer Relations and Operations ","company":" Bytewax "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614Z"}
