[WARN] The rowtime column 'timestamp' for this table is nullable

IMPORT ecommerceTs.Customer;

The rowtime column is used to advance the watermark and for time-based operations. When it is null, the watermark does not advance and the record can be ignored for time-based operations, leading to unexpected output and performance issues.

Ensure that the rowtime column always has a value by filtering or setting a default. If that is the case but the compiler doesn't recognize it, explicitly cast it in the table definition.
For example:
`timestamp AS CAST(TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(lastUpdated, 0) AS TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3) NOT NULL)`

SQRL does not support function overloading, i.e. functions or relationships
with identical names but different parameter signatures.
