[WARN] The rowtime column 'timestamp' for this table is nullable
in script:parsererror-basetable-relationship-fail.sqrl [3:1]:
IMPORT ecommerceTs.Customer;

FilteredCustomer := SELECT * FROM Customer;
^
The rowtime column is used to advance the watermark and for time-based operations. When it is null, the watermark does not advance and the record can be ignored for time-based operations, leading to unexpected output and performance issues.

Ensure that the rowtime column always has a value by filtering or setting a default. If that is the case but the compiler doesn't recognize it, explicitly cast it in the table definition.
For example:
`timestamp AS CAST(TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(lastUpdated, 0) AS TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3) NOT NULL)`

[FATAL] Relationships can only be added to the base table [`default_catalog`.`default_database`.`Customer`]
in script:parsererror-basetable-relationship-fail.sqrl [4:1]:

FilteredCustomer := SELECT * FROM Customer;
FilteredCustomer.relationship := SELECT * FROM Customer other WHERE this.customerid = other.customerid;
^
When a table A has the same schema as the table B that it selects from, table B is called the
base table for table A.

Relationships can only be added to base tables.
