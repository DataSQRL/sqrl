As data platforms and systems scale so does the ability of stakeholders to create more and more data. More data means things are harder to find. Data products need to be cataloged on the go not only for discovery but also for governance purposes. Not only that, data can exist in many forms - reports, tables, files, streams, services, logs and may go through multiple hops of processing by multiple teams before it becomes a curated data product. Furthermore, a typical data organization will have a plethora of platform and infrastructure pieces - some open source, some cloud based and some custom. To build a robust discovery ecosystem, cataloging must happen continuously, at each hop and for every component in the organization. This becomes challenging without a central team overseeing the entire process.\n\nIn this presentation, I will talk about how we solved the problem of cataloging and discovery using Datahub as our discovery platform. I will cover the details of how we went about ingesting metadata from a plethora of infrastructure and platform components(such as Snowflake, Looker, Terraform, Airflow, Kinesis, custom declarative configs etc) that are involved in a typical data product lifecycle at Chime. I will also talk about the processes and design principles we used to make cataloging and data governance a part of our dna.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Sherin Thomas ","title":" Staff Software Engineer ","company":" Sherin Thomas "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

Recently, initiatives like Data Mesh have recognized that pushing analytics products down to people at all levels of the org chart can make for a more responsive and competitive organization. But what about people outside the organization? It used to be that you wanted to see their data, but now they need to see yours. Users are the final frontier of analytics, and going forward, you may have less and less of a choice whether to expose analytics products to your customers themselves.\n\nThis requires a completely re-engineered approach to data infrastructure. Apache Pinot is a database built from the ground up to ingest streaming data from Apache Kafka and serve filtered, grouped, and aggregated results in tens of milliseconds rather than tens of seconds. Built at LinkedIn to expose the social network's data to users as game-changing application features, Pinot is now powering user-facing analytics in real-time, event-driven systems in many different businesses all over the world.

Responding to an ever changing landscape of attacks and exploits requires a system that can not only handle the scale and dynamic nature of the data but also a dynamically changing set of detection rules. We developed Confluent SIGMA, an open source project built on Kafka Streams for the open SIGMA DSL, to handle real-time rule additions and modifications. In this talk we will cover:\n* The architecture of our Kafka Streams layer that makes it possible to use external data feeds as rule input\n* How we handle dynamic criteria for joins and filters\n* Best practices for writing dynamic rule engines in Kafka Streams\n* Upcoming improvements to Kafka Streams to support versioned rules\nAlthough Confluent SIGMA focuses on cyber threat detection this same pattern can also be applied to any DSL (domain specific language) that would benefit from real-time stream processing.

These real time applications were built upon diverged frameworks (e.g. Spark Streaming, Storm, Flink, and internally developed frameworks using Kafka Consumer API) without standardization on processing logics. It led to repeated processing of similar logic, multiple codebases to maintain, low data quality, and inconsistency with offline datasets. These negatively impact scalability, reliability, efficiency and data accuracy of these applications and eventually affect the real-time content recommendation quality and user experience.\n\nTo address these challenges, we unified the way of consuming events in our real time applications by consolidating the compute engines to Flink, splitting events in those common topics by engagement types, generating cleansed events with standardized processing to align on business concepts. Throughout these efforts, we achieved multi-million dollar infrastructure savings and double-digit engagement gain after applications adopted those cleansed events.\n\nMoving forward, we are implementing frameworks for better tracking and governing the Kafka events and real time use cases.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Lu Liu ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Pinterest "},{"name":" Heng Zhang ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Pinterest "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

These two distinct competing functions invariably contend for the available compute resources, which makes it difficult to handle situations where there are unexpected bursts of either streaming ingestion or queries that can slow down the system. We will examine common approaches to the problem of compute contention, such as scaling, replication, and querying from shared storage, and discuss their tradeoffs and how they remain incomplete solutions.\n\nIn this talk, we will present a real-time analytics architecture we implemented in the Rockset database, based on RocksDB, that effectively isolates streaming data ingestion from query serving. RocksDB is a popular log-structured merge-tree storage engine that writes to an in-memory memtable and periodically flushes to disk.\n\nCore to our architecture is the separation of compute and storage. This allows multiple RocksDB instances to query from the same shared storage. We use cloud object storage to ensure durability and use SSD as a shared hot storage tier for low-latency reads. On the compute side, we designed our query processing engine to be completely separate from all the modules that perform data ingestion.\n\nFor fresh data to be available to multiple compute units, it is essential that the in-memory state of the ingester's RocksDB memtable be replicated to other RocksDB instances. We built a RocksDB memtable replicator that propagates changes to remote instances in single-digit milliseconds. This architecture enables compute isolation so that real-time streaming ingestion does not interfere with queries, while still allowing the most recent data to be queried.","location":"Breakout Room 4","speakers":[{"name":" Nathan Bronson ","title":" Principal Architect ","company":" Rockset "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

However, this is a difficult task for two reasons. First, cutting costs without sacrificing latency or correctness requires deep knowledge of engine implementation details and a keen eye to identify opportunities. Second, optimization techniques are less accessible when working with high-level language abstraction, such as SQL. These techniques often involve engine query planning, requiring even deeper expertise. Many Data Engineers and Data Scientists prefer not to deal with Intermediate Representations (IR) and optimization rules. They also may not care too deeply about the details of applying streaming watermarks to reduce the runtime complexity for Point-In-Time-Correct join queries.\n\nIn this talk, I will share some simple optimization techniques you can apply with streaming SQL in just a few minutes that can cut costs by 10x or even 100x. Then, we’ll gradually dive deeper into some novel optimization techniques that can be applied across your distributed storage and compute stacks.\n\nBy the end of this talk, if you are a Data Engineer or a Data Scientist who is looking to build real-time streaming workloads but have concerns about cost, I hope you’ll be able to walk away with some tricks so you can check that box on your product ROI OKR :) If you are a platform engineer, I hope you will learn how to apply optimization abstractions across various compute and storage engines in your platform.","location":"Breakout Room 5","speakers":[{"name":" Zhenzhong Xu ","title":" Co-founder & CTO ","company":" Claypot AI, Inc.

How Would We?","abstract":"Although cloud-based, managed Kafka offerings abstract away most administrative responsibilities, a few admin-related concerns remain––like cluster scaling. When is scaling your cloud-based Kafka appropriate? And how should you set it up to auto-scale?\n\nGone are the days of over-provisioning resources to meet expected demand. Technologies like kubernetes make it relatively simple to implement strategies around both horizontal and vertical scaling. Cloud providers give users the ability to track their resource utilization and set up autoscaling groups and policies. Cloud administrators use these tools (and others) to guarantee their applications can handle the demands placed on them. With Kafka being a central pillar of our cloud-native data pipelines it requires administrators to determine if, when and how to scale Kafka as their workloads ebb and flow.\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore the topic of auto-scaling by implementing a strategy for Confluent Cloud resources. We’ll first discuss common use cases that dictate a need to create a scaling strategy for Confluent Cloud and introduce the approaches best suited for each use case. With a nod to both where we came from and where we are going, we will discuss the architecture of Confluent Cloud and how it affects the way we scale Kafka.

Since services usually don't operate in isolation, it's vital to implement proper communication models among them. A crucial aspect in this regard is to avoid tight coupling and numerous point-to-point connections between any two services. One effective approach is to build upon messaging infrastructure as a decoupling element and employ an event-driven application architecture.\n\nDuring this session, we explore selected event-driven architecture patterns commonly found in the field: the claim-check pattern, the content enricher pattern, the message translator pattern, and the outbox pattern. For each of the four patterns, we look into a live demo scenario based on Apache Kafka and discuss some variations and trade-offs regarding the chosen implementation.\n\nYou will walk away with a solid understanding of how the discussed event-driven architecture patterns help you with building robust and decoupled service-to-service communication and how to apply them in your next Apache Kafka-based project.","location":"Breakout Room 5","speakers":[{"name":" Hans-Peter Grahsl ","title":" Developer Advocate ","company":" Red Hat "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

While the legacy flow did the trick for the most part, it occasionally behaved in unexpected ways that frustrated the team and worse, could pose a risk to our SLAs. During the process of designing, building, deploying and monitoring the new Kafka-based pipeline, we learned several valuable lessons. Here’s a glimpse of what we discovered:\n1. Designing the message key is intertwined with both business logic and throughput analysis\n2. The error flows you design may behave in ways you didn’t expect\n3. It can be actually helpful to keep both legacy and new flows alive\n4. The power of monitoring and alerting from day one, combined with gradual rollout\n5. Throughput will still be limited by the weakest link in the pipeline, regardless of how powerful your infrastructure and frameworks are\n6.

Even more so for data scientists who have often been brought up with batch processing and files and typically have only heard of Kafka, but never really used it. Now, do you need to hire a team of Kafka experts, or is there another way?\nWe came up with a novel way to bridge the gap between the batch and file-based world of most data scientists and the world of real-time and streaming using a new Open Source data-processing tool called kash.py (\"Kafka Shell for Python\").\nkash.py allows any Python programmer and data scientist to access the Kafka API in an easier way than ever before. It offers a large number of easy-to-use abstractions on top of the Kafka API, including bash-inspired commands like \"ls\" or \"l\" for listing Kafka topics and \"cat\", \"head\" or \"tail\" for displaying topic content. kash.py bridges the gap between the file and the streaming worlds with the \"cp\" command to upload a file to a topic, or to download a topic to a file, and offers commands inspired by functional programming to do Kafka-Kafka/File-Kafka or Kafka-File stream processing (\"map\", \"flatMap\", \"filter\" etc.) in one-liners - of course with full support for JSON Schema, Avro and Protobuf.

We renegotiate aged social conventions by focusing on treating data as a product, with a clearly defined data product owner, akin to that of any other product. In addition, we focus on building out a self-service platform with integrated governance, letting consumers safely access and use the data they need to solve their business problems.\n\nData mesh is prescribed as a solution for _analytical data_, so that conventionally analytical results (think weekly sales or monthly revenue reports) can be more accurately and predictably computed. But what about non-analytical business operations? Would they not also benefit from data products backed by self-service capabilities and dedicated owners? If you've ever provided a customer with an analytical report that differed from their operational conclusions, then this talk is for you.\n\nAdam discusses the resounding successes he has seen from applying data mesh _off-label_ to both analytical and operational domains. The key? Event streams. Well-defined, incrementally updating data products that can power both real-time and batch-based applications, providing a single source of data for a wide variety of application and analytical use cases. Adam digs into the common areas of success seen across numerous clients and customers and provides you with a set of practical guidelines for implementing your own minimally viable data mesh.\n\nFinally, Adam covers the main social and technical hurdles that you'll encounter as you implement your own data mesh.

We define these gray failures as events where a broker slows or stops request processing while continuing to lead a partition. A single broker gray failure often has cascading impact for key-based partitioning producers, creating back pressure and upstream lag for messages to all brokers. While there have been adaptive partition switching improvements (e.g. KIP-794 Strictly Uniform Sticky Partitioner) that allow producers to route around problematic brokers, these do not work for key-based partitioning strategies.\n\nIn this talk I describe partition multihoming (PMH), a form of virtual partitioning where two or more physical Kafka partitions are guaranteed to be consumed by the same consumer instance. When a broker is unhealthy, a multihoming partitioner can route messages through partitions led by a healthy broker destined to the same consumer as before the failure, preserving application functionality.\n\nWe will go over:\n\n* The real world impact of gray failures that led to the creation of PMH\n\n* The implementation details of PMH on key-based topics\n\n* The PMH workflow when a broker becomes unhealthy\n\n* The future roadmap for adding virtual partitioning in Apache Kafka for PMH\n\nAfter this talk you will understand why PMH is key to reliability and should become a first-class feature of Kafka.","location":"Breakout Room 4","speakers":[{"name":" Christopher Wildman ","title":" Principal Software Engineer ","company":" New Relic "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most common ways to provide security for data in motion. Access control privileges that are defined in a RBAC service determine which role can access and perform operations on specific resources. In this talk, we first present the state of the art in Role-Based Access Control for streaming data in Apache Kafka. We then present a novel approach where we bring the same RBAC concepts from relational systems to the data in motion space and compare it with the current solutions.\n\nAttendees will learn about the state of the art in security and Role-Based Access Control in data streaming technologies and understand challenges in these approaches.

Think about delays in airlines (Logistics), food delivery tracking (Apps), detect fraudulent transactions (Fintech), flagging computers for intrusion (Cybersecurity), device health (IoT), and many more.\n\nFor instance, at Conviva, our customers want to analyze the buffering that users on some types of devices suffer, when using a specific CDN.\n\nWe refer to such problems as Multidimensional Time-State Analytics. Time-State here refers to the stateful context-sensitive analysis over event streams needed to capture metrics of interest, in contrast to simple aggregations. Multidimensional refers to the need to run ad hoc queries to drill down into subpopulations of interest. Furthermore, we need both real-time streaming and offline retrospective analysis capabilities.\n\nIn this talk, we will share our experiences to explain why state-of-art systems offer poor abstractions to tackle such workloads and why they suffer from poor cost-performance tradeoffs and significant complexity.\n\nWe will also describe Conviva’s architectural and algorithmic efforts to tackle these challenges. We present early evidence on how raising the level of abstraction can reduce developer effort, bugs, and cloud costs by (up to) an order of magnitude, and offer a unified framework to support both streaming and retrospective analysis. We will also discuss how our ideas can be plugged into existing pipelines and how our new ``visual'' abstraction can democratize analytics across many domains and to non-programmers.","location":"Breakout Room 2","speakers":[{"name":" Henry Milner ","title":" Principal Engineer ","company":" Conviva "},{"name":" Vyas Sekar ","title":" Chief Scientist ","company":" Conviva "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

It is used in every line of Robinhood’s business, from stock and crypto trading to self-clearing, market data and data science. Most of our microservices are written in either Golang or Python, and we have multiple librdkafka-based client library wrappers (kafkahood) developed in both languages. As Robinhood grows, it has become challenging for infrastructure engineers to manage the different requirements that the multitude of application teams have for their producers and consumers. To efficiently manage all Kafka consumers at Robinhood, we have developed a Consumer Proxy that decouples the following:\n\n● Kafka consumer logic from message processing in application business logic\n\n● Resource utilization in Kafka consumer from that in application container\n\n● Kafka consumer failure from application failure\n\nThe Consumer Proxy is built in a Kubernetes sidecar container, it offers stateless processing, and it manages commits and timeouts. Most importantly, applications need the ability to scale up during market hours and scale down after extended trading hours, and the Consumer Proxy will allow them to easily rebalance consumer groups during these scaling events. Eventually, specific language library wrappers can remain a \"thin\" layer whose complexities are only to facilitate the business logic of the corresponding application team with what they should do with the payload.\n\nUnifying Kafka consumers and producers for an application team in one sidecar proxy container allows the infrastructure team to effectively manage clients at Robinhood. If your organization is looking to centralize Kafka consumption logic to a singular client library (instead of multiple different client libraries), please attend this talk to see how Robinhood does it so that the infrastructure team can focus development on a singular library rather than N different client libraries.","location":"Breakout Room 4","speakers":[{"name":" Tony Chen ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Robinhood "},{"name":" Mun Yong Jang ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Robinhood "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

For all the benefits that MSAs bring over monolithic application architectures, they expose developers to all sorts of tough distributed systems problems, making it non-trivial to build applications that are consistent, scalable, and resilient.\n\nBuilding applications in an event-driven way is a great start to get MSA complexity under control, by leveraging the guarantees of logs/message queues (like Kafka) to offload some of the problems. Stream processing systems (KStreams, Flink, etc.) can be powerful tools as well. Their tight integration of state, messaging, and application logic yields strong guarantees, like exactly-once state & event-delivery semantics. However, having been built originally for data processing, those systems cannot easily express business logic with complex control-flow, orchestration tasks, or workflows. Existing systems also have very different operational characteristics compared to stateless service deployments.\n\nIn this session, we share ideas from a novel system we are developing, called 'Restate'. Our work is inspired by event-sourcing and stream processing systems, but rethought from the ground up for microservices. Restate connects services with each other (and between services and Kafka), and handles crucial aspects like state, communication, failover, and consistency. It does that with a programming model that is crafted not for data processing or analytics, but for services and applications with complex interactions and control flow. The result is an elegant experience of writing applications that are simple, consistent, yet highly resilient and scalable.\n\nWe believe that Restate complements the current landscape of event-processing systems, by offering a solution for cases where events facilitate control flow and coordination, rather than real-time data processing.","location":"Breakout Room 5","speakers":[{"name":" Stephan Ewen ","title":" Founder & CEO ","company":" Restate "},{"name":" Giselle van Dongen ","title":" Developer Advocate ","company":" Restate "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

While there is a deep desire to build this architecture incrementally from streaming data sources like Kafka, it is very challenging with current technologies available on lakehouses; a lot of technologies can’t efficiently update records or efficiently process incremental data without recomputing all the data to serve low-latency tables. Apache Hudi is a transactional data lake platform with full mutability support, including streaming upserts, and provides a powerful incremental processing framework. Apache Hudi powers the largest transactional data lakes in the industry, differentiating on fast upserts and change streams to only process and serve the change records.\n\nTo further improve the upsert performance, Hudi now supports a new record-level index that deterministically maps the record key to the file location orders of magnitude faster. As a result, Hudi speeds up computationally expensive MERGE operations even more by avoiding full table scans. On the query side, Hudi now supports database-style change data capture with before, and after images to chain flow of inserts, updates and deletes change records from bronze to silver to gold tables.\n\nIn this talk, attendees will walk away with:\n\n- The current challenges of building a medallion architecture at low-latency\n\n- How the record index and incremental updates work with Apache Hudi\n\n- How the new Hudi CDC feature unlocks incremental processing on the lake\n\n- How you can efficiently build a medallion architecture by avoiding expensive operations","location":"Breakout Room 2","speakers":[{"name":" Nadine Farah ","title":" Head of Dev Rel ","company":" Onehouse "},{"name":" Ethan Guo ","title":" Database Engineer ","company":" Onehouse "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

However, many CDC deployments are static: e.g. a single connector is configured to ingest data for one or several tables.\n\nAt Goldsky, we needed a way to configure CDC for a large Postgres database dynamically: the list of tables to ingest is driven by customer-facing features and is constantly changing.\n\nWe started using Flink CDC connectors built on top of the Debezium project, but we immediately faced many challenges caused mainly by the lack of incremental snapshotting.\n\nBut even after implementing incremental snapshotting ourselves, we still faced an issue around using replication slots in Postgres: we couldn't use a single connector to ingest all tables (it's just too much data), and we couldn't create a new connector for every new set of tables (we'd quickly run out of replication slots). So we needed to find a way to maintain a fixed number of replication slots for a dynamic list of tables.\n\nIn the end, we chose a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute the list of tables across multiple Flink jobs. The jobs also required some customizations to support the incremental snapshotting semantics from Flink CDC.\n\nWe learned a lot about Debezium, Flink CDC and Postgres replication, and we're excited to share our learnings with the community!","location":"Breakout Room 3","speakers":[{"name":" Xiao Meng ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" Goldsky "},{"name":" Yaroslav Tkachenko ","title":" Principal Software Engineer ","company":" Goldsky "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

Since then our needs have expanded to include many-to-one and many-to-many replication.\n\nIn this talk we'll discuss what bottlenecks we have hit as we scaled out, and what measures we took to remove them, such as:\n\n- Replicating data based on Kafka Headers\n\n- Connecting to many source and destination Kafka clusters\n\n- Managing the replication of Kafka topics of varying traffic\n\n- The use of an intermediary Kafka cluster\n\nAt the end of this talk you will understand how we have scaled replication and routing to support New Relic's ever growing data ingestion, and all the mitigations it took to get us there.","location":"Breakout Room 4","speakers":[{"name":" Julia Holgado ","title":" Software Engineer ","company":" New Relic "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

The power of a single story goes far beyond simply relaying facts and data and can be a highly effective tool tocreate customer loyalty. Stories emotionalize information. They give color and depth to otherwise bland material and they allow people to connect with the message in a deeper, more meaningful way. Those potential customers/investors can then connect with your product, service and your entire business in a way that will make you talk about differently. In this session we will look at four key stories that every business should be telling as well as what the elements that make your story stand out. Stories are extremely important and necessary in the world of business, but all stories are not treated equally. How do you identify the right story for your business? Connect with your audience emotionally? Therefore making your business and product come alive for your customer.","location":"Spotlight Theater (Expo Hall)","speakers":[{"name":" TyKeshia Spells ","title":" Director, Content Strategy ","company":" Stand Together "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

For example, if we have user logs coming off a Kafka topic, we can perform windowed joins and aggregations in real-time to predict if a user is going to click on an advertisement, or is committing fraud. We can come up with a multitude of these features and store them in Redis, which can feed a ML prediction service.\n\nHow do we decide which real-time feature to use? We could do A/B tests on live data. This is expensive and will take a long time to generate statistically significant results.\n\nPeople typically dump historical Kafka partitions in cheap cloud storage. Can we use this historical data to \"backtest\" our features? This could allow data scientists to use batch analytics systems like SparkSQL and BigQuery to rapidly iterate on real-time features.\n\nThe key question to answer: given a Flink job definition of a real-time feature, the historical Kafka data and an exact point in time in history, can we confidently say what the feature value would have been in Redis?\n\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate that it is impossible to accurately answer this question. Approaches such as Flink's batch mode are not able to accurately handle late events and indicate when in processing time a window closed. In fact, they practically guarantee feature leakage.\n\nThe key reason behind the challenge is that historical Kafka records only contains Kafka producer timestamps (event time), and does not contain the processing time. This makes it extremely challenging to say with certainty what records would have made it into a particular window, and when exactly in processing time an event time window fires based on watermarks.\n\nI will then talk about assumptions we can make to get \"good enough\" backfill results that try to avoid feature leakage. The best approach likely depends on your particular Kafka/Flink setup.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Tony Wang ","title":" PhD Student ","company":" Stanford "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

This includes ingestion latency (ingestion timestamp - event timestamp), consumer latency (consumer wallclock timestamp - ingestion time);\nWhilst there are tools like kafka.tools.TestEndToEndLatency for running such tests with producer/consumer primitives, testing a higher order producer like Kafka Connect source connector is a challenge. Many users rely on manual, ad-hoc observations for benchmarking how long it took for a source connector to write a record into Kafka.\nIn this session, we shall cover kafka-latency-analyzer, a script that can use configurable timestamps to produce quantile reports of latency (focused on average and tail) at a topic level and optionally relay such results downstream to another kafka topic for analysis ans also includes features such as sampling; This approach is useful for providing latency SLAs, as well as for performing exploratory benchmarks & tuning of clients/connectors;\nWhat we shall cover:\n1. Understanding ingestion latency: CreateTime vs LogAppendTime (and why additional timestamps need to be injected for true event time in sources)\n2. Understanding other connector bound latencies involved (such as SMT chains with connectors)\n3. Understanding consumer / processing latency, as seen by a consumer: ie, WallClockTime (although we shall also consider how to introduce timestamp injection for sink-side write)\n4.

Not all workflows are applicable to all assets, and some workflows depend on other workflows to run. Additionally, new workflows are introduced regularly, and they need to be executed on existing assets, as well.\n\nWe implemented a workflow rule engine that allows users to define rules and conditions to specify the applicable workflows for assets, based on their types, metadata and states. In order to make this system scalable and fault tolerant, we utilize Kafka to send out events on asset state changes (on create, update, workflow completion, etc.) with minimal information in the payload (asset id and version). The rule engine then enriches this payload by fetching additional metadata, evaluates it against the workflow rules, triggers applicable workflows based on the outcome, and monitors their results by listening to the workflow events.\n\nBy using a highly available Kafka setup, we can easily scale, handle ETL cases such as migrations, replay messages if needed without impacting asset ingestions.","location":"Breakout Room 1 (Livestream)","speakers":[{"name":" Burak Bacioglu ","title":" Staff Software Engineer ","company":" Netflix "},{"name":" Meenakshi Jindal ","title":" Staff Software Engineer ","company":" Netflix "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

Specifically focused on Evernorth Health Service's journey of implementing microservices data pipelines, we provide an overview of the patterns we used while implementing CDC data pipelines for these micro services using confluent kafka, the challenges we faced, lessons learned and the unique solutions that we developed over the years to overcome those challenges. We also look at how we are moving these micro services eco systems to public cloud (AWS) and the strategies that we have/are implementing to ensure a smooth consumer cutover. We peek into how kafka consumers can cutover to a replicated topic using offsets based on create time timestamps and how/why this is critical for a downtime-less and data-loss-less consumer cutover for streaming consumers. To conclude, we take a look at how we are re-imagining these pipelines on AWS and how SaaS offerings like Confluent Cloud and Confluent connectors could play a major role.","location":"Breakout Room 3","speakers":[{"name":" Nilay Sundarkar ","title":" Principal Engineer ","company":" Evernorth Health Services "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}

Last year we open sourced Venice, which means that you (Yeah! You!!) can deploy and run Venice in your stack. Venice is designed from the ground up with asynchrony in mind, making it a great fit for ingesting the output of your stream processing jobs. It also supports Lambda and Kappa architectures out of the box.\n\nThis talk presents Venice and deep dives into how we designed it to enable high data ingestion volumes via Kafka, merging it all coherently from many data sources and many geographically distributed regions. Venice’s active-active replication allows write operations to be produced in any region and be consumed in any order by all other regions, while still achieving eventual consistency. We’ll cover how Venice’s conflict resolution strategy can be a powerful abstraction when dealing with many writers.","location":"Breakout Room 5","speakers":[{"name":" Zac Policzer ","title":" Senior Staff Engineer ","company":" LinkedIn "}],"last_updated":"2023-09-18T18:49:17.798614+05:30"}
