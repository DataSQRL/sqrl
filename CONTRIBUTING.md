# Sign Your Work

The _sign-off_ is a simple line at the end of the message for a commit. All commits need to be signed. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the material (see [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org)):

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Git has a [`-s`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```bash
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```
