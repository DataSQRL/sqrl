# PostgreSQL Engine Configuration

PostgreSQL is a realtime database that stores the materialized views and tables generated by your DataSQRL pipeline for low-latency querying.

## Configuration Options

No mandatory configuration keys are required. Physical DDL (tables, indexes, views) is produced automatically by the DataSQRL compiler.

## Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "postgres": {
      "config": {
        // Optional PostgreSQL-specific settings
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Notes

- Database schema is automatically generated from your SQRL script
- Tables, indexes, and views are created based on the compiled data pipeline
- Connection parameters are typically provided via environment variables
- The engine handles both real-time data ingestion and query serving
- Optimized for low-latency reads of materialized data
