# DataSQRL 0.6 Release: The Streaming Data Framework

The DataSQRL community is proud to announce the release of DataSQRL 0.6. This release marks a major milestone in the evolution of our open-source project, bringing enhanced alignment with Flink SQL and powerful new capabilities to the real-time serving layer.

You can find the full release notes and source code on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/DataSQRL/sqrl/releases/tag/0.6.0). 
To get started with the latest compiler, simply pull the latest Docker image:
```bash
docker pull datasqrl/cmd:0.6.0
```

## A New Chapter: Flink SQL Integration

With DataSQRL 0.6, we are embracing the Flink ecosystem more deeply than ever before. This release introduces a complete re-architecture of the DataSQRL compiler to build directly on top of Flink SQL's parser and planner. By aligning our internal model with Flink SQL semantics, we unlock a host of new capabilities and bring DataSQRL users closer to the vibrant Flink ecosystem.

This architectural shift allows DataSQRL to:

* **Use Flink SQL syntax as the foundation**, enabling more intuitive query definitions and easier onboarding for users familiar with Flink.
* **Extend Flink SQL with domain-specific features**, such as declarative relationship definitions and functions to define the data interface.
* **Transpile FlinkSQL to database dialects** for query execution.

## Serving-Layer Power: Functions & Relationships

DataSQRL 0.6 introduces first-class support for defining **functions** and **relationships** in your SQRL scripts. These constructs make it easier to model complex application logic in a modular, declarative fashion.

These features are purpose-built for powering LLM-ready APIs, event-driven architectures, and real-time user-facing applications.

Check out the [language documentation](/docs/sqrl-language) for details.

## Developer Tooling

DataSQRL 0.6 provides a docker image for compiling, running, and testing SQRL projects. You can now quickly iterate and check the results. Or run automated tests in CI/CD.

## Deployment Artifacts

DataSQRL 0.6 removes deployment profiles and instead generates all deployment artifacts in the `build/deploy/plan` folder. This makes it easier to integrate with Kubernetes deployment processes (e.g. via Helm) or cloud managed service deployments (e.g. via Terraform).

## Breaking Changes & Migration Path

As this is a major release, **DataSQRL 0.6 is not backwards compatible** with version 0.5. The syntax and internal representation have been updated to align with Flink SQL and to support the new compiler architecture.

To help you transition, we’ve provided updated examples and migration guidance in the [DataSQRL examples repository](https://github.com/DataSQRL/datasqrl-examples). We recommend starting with one of the updated use cases to get a feel for the new workflow.

## Thanks to the Community
