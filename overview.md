# Developer Documentation

The DataSQRL project consists of two parts:

* The DataSQRL build tool: Compiles SQRL script and (optional) API schema to an
  integrated data pipeline or event-driven microservice by producing the deployment
  assets for all components of the pipeline or microservice.
* The DataSQRL runtime components: libraries and components that are executed
  as part of a compiled data pipeline when the deployment assets are deployed.

This repository contains the code for both parts as well. Code that is shared
between the build tool and runtime is in the [sqrl-base](sqrl-base) module.

## DataSQRL Build Tool

The goal of the DataSQRL build tool is simplifying the development of data pipelines
and event-driven microservices. Developers can ipmlement the logic of their
data product in SQL and define how they want to serve the data product through an
API specification. The build tool compiles those two artifacts into an integrated
data pipeline that ingests, processes, stores, and serves the data as defined.

DataSQRL has it's own variant of SQL called SQRL. SQRL extends SQL to allow
explicit imports and nested tables to represent hierarchical data natively. It
also provides some syntactic sugar to make it more convenient to develop with SQL.

DataSQRL supports a pluggable engine architecture. A data pipeline or microservice
consists of multiple stages and each stage is executed by an engine.
For example, a data pipeline may consist of a stream processing, storage, and
serving stage which are executed by Apache Flink, PostgreSQL, and Vert.x, respectively.

DataSQRL supports the following types of stages:

* Stream Processing: For processing data as it is ingested
* Log: For moving data between stages reliably
* Database: For storage and querying data
* Server: For returning data through an API upon request

A data pipeline topology is a sequence of stages. A pipeline topology may contain
multiple stages of the same type (e.g. two different database stages).
An engine is what executes the deployment assets for a given stage.
For example, the FlinkSQL generated by the compiler as part of the deployment assets for the "stream" stage is
executed by the Flink engine.

The pipeline topology as well as other compiler configuration options are
specified in a json configuration file typically called `package.json`.

In addition to the compiler, the DataSQRL build tool contains a package manager
for resolving external data and
function dependencies, pre-processors for preparing dependencies, and post-processors
for refining the deployment artifacts produced by the compiler to the specified
engine configuration.

The DataSQRL build tool consists of the following components (i.e. java modules),
listed in the order in which they are invoked when compiling a SQRL script:

### Packager

The packager prepares the build directory for the compiler. The job of the
packager is to populate the `build` directory with all the files needed by the
compiler, so that the compiler can operate exclusively on the build directory and
have all the files it needs prepared in a standard way.

The packager
resolves external data and function dependencies that are imported in a script.
It downloads such dependencies from a central repository if necessary and places
them in the build directory.

The packager also runs all registered pre-processors on the local directory
to pre-process input files and place them into the build directory for the
compiler. DataSQRL has a generic pre-processor framework.

### Transpiler

The transpiler is the first stage of the compiler. The transpiler parses the
SQRL script into a logical plan by "translating" the SQRL SQL variant into
vanilla SQL with hints to annotate context.

The transpiler resolves imports against the build directory using module loaders
that retrieve dependencies. It maintains a schema of all defined tables
in a SQRL script. It also parses the API specification and maps the API schema
the table schemas.

The transpiler is build on top of Apache Calcite for all SQL handling and
java-graphql for all GraphQL handling.

### Logical Plan Rewriter

The logical plan rewriter is the second stage of the compiler. It takes the
logical plan (i.e. Relnode) produced by the transpiler for each table
defined in the SQRL script and rewrites the logical plan into a normalized
represenation (called the AnnotatedLP) which serves these purposes:

1. It keeps track of important metadata like timestamps, primary keys, sort orders, etc
2. It translates SQRL specific SQL annotations into standard SQL depending on the
   context in which they are used. The goal is to translate SQL developers are
   likely to write to SQL that is optimized for the context in which they wrote that SQL.
   For example, rewriting an unspecified JOIN into a temporal join if the join is between
   a stream and a state on the state's primary key.
3. It extracts certain "expensive" logical operators with the goal of trying
   to move them to another stage in the pipeline where they are cheaper to
   execute while guaranteeing the same semantics.

In other words, the LP Rewriter attempts to rewrite SQL query for a table
definition to make it more efficient while preserving user intent and it
extract metadata needed for contextual processing.

[The LP Rewriter is part of the planner](sqrl-planner)

### DAG Planner

The DAG planner takes all the individual table defintions and assembles them into
a processing DAG. It prunes the DAG and rewrites the DAG before optimizing the
DAG to assign each node (i.e. table) to a stage in the pipeline.

The optimizer uses a cost model and is constrained to produce only viable
pipelines.

At the end of the DAG planning process, each table defined in the SQRL script
is assigned to a stage in the pipeline.

### Physical Planner

All the tables in a given stage are then passed to the stage engine's physical
planner which produces the physical plan for the engine that has been
configured to execute that stage.

For example, the tables assigned to the "stream" stage are passed to
Flink's physical planner to produce FlinkSQL.

The physical plans are then written out as deployment assets to the `build/deploy`
directory.

### Discovery

The build tool contains a separate piece of functionality for data discovery.
The goal for data discovery is to make it easy for new users to get started
with DataSQRL by automatically generating package definitions for users' data.

The user can run discovery against local data files, object storage, or a Kafka
cluster. Data discovery analyzes the data and ingests it to determine the schema
automatically. It then produces a package for the data that the user can
import into their scripts.

### Command Line Interface

The DataSQRL build tool is accessed through a command line interface.
It defines all of the commands that DataSQRL supports and provides
usability features to help the user and produce useful error messages.

### Testing

Integration tests for the DataSQRL build tool can be found in
`sqrl-testing/sqrl-integration-tests`

## DataSQRL Runtime

The DataSQRL project also contains some runtime components that get executed
as part of the data pipeline compiled by the DataSQRL build tool:

### Server

The server module contains the default server implemented based on Vert.x.
The server takes a configuration file as input which maps each API entry point
to a single or set of SQL queries that are executed against the database on
request.

The server processes mutations by creating events and persisting them to a log.
The server handles subscriptions by listening to new log events and forwarding
them to clients.

The configuration file that defines the behavior of the server is a
deployment asset produced by the DataSQRL build tool for the "server" stage.

### Flink Libraries

DataSQRL extends the standard SQL function library with many additional function
modules. Those are executed at runtime in Flink or on the server.
The functions are iplemented in the `sqrl-flink-lib` module.

It also contains custom formats and connectors for Flink that extend
existing formats and connectors to support functionality needed by DataSQRL.
It may be reasonable to contribute those improvements and extensions back to
the Apache Flink project.
